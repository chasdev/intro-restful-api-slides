###Charlie's Perspective Talk
<br /><br />
#####Personal/Organization Culture/Maturity
<br />
We've made progress, but...




###Does anyone think we're agile?

###Efficient? 

###Mature?

<br /><br /><br /><br />
Me either.




###We debate the easy stuff

- Git. No, Subversion. Git. TCS. No, Git...
  - Not using Git?  Unless you are 'Banner 8' you have no excuse

- Markdown?  No, MSFT Word. Sharepoint.  Robohelp. 
  - Grrrrr.  

- "It's ok you don't have automated tests, you can ship..."
  - Really?

- MSFT Windows is a fine developer platform for Java
  - Immediate fail. 

- Project in trouble?  Let's add more folks!
  - Yeah, that always works...
<br /><br />
/YOU:  Wow Charlie, are you just going to vent?




###We have real problems to solve





###How to mitigate our (growing) technical debt

- Code reviews?  
- A broader Technical Currency initiative?
 - Rapid adoption of best practices and new libraries
<br />
- Adjust some focus away from legacy ERP evolution?
- Just say 'no'




###How to improve quality

- Consolidation of Continuous Integration?  (as a service?)
- Behavior Driven Development (BDD) 
- Automation over manual test cases
- QA?




###How to improve productivity and time-to-market
