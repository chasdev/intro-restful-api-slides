###Charlie's Perspective Talk
<br /><br />






###Does anyone think we're current?

###agile?

###Efficient?

###Mature?

<br /><br /><br /><br />
Me either.






###So, How do we improve?

- Change our culture
- Raise the bar
- Focus on hard problems






###Our culture encourages

<br /><br />

- doing 'the right thing'

<br />

aka the 'MIT/Stanford Style of design'




####But why not

<br /><br />

- 'worse is better'

<br />

aka the 'New Jersey Style of design'




####Simplicity

MIT:<br />
Simplicity is important; more important in interfaces than implementation

<br />

NJ:<br />
Simplicity is important; more important in implmementation than interfaces.<br />
"Simplicity is the most important consideration in a design"






###Our culture encourages

<br /><br />

- 'feature richness'




####But why not

<br /><br />

- 'less is more'






###Our culture encourages

<br /><br />

- 'yes, we can add that feature'




####But why not

<br /><br />

- 'opinionated software'
- 'just say no'






###Our culture encourages

<br /><br />

- an 'enterprisey' focus




####But why not

<br /><br />

- a 'narrow focus'
- YAGNI






###Our culture encourages

<br /><br />

- the 'boat anchor' anti-pattern




####But why not

<br /><br />

- throw away bad tools, practices more quickly






###Our culture encourages

<br /><br />

- slow adoption of tools, frameworks, etc.




####But why not

<br /><br />

- aggressively try out new stuff









###We debate the easy stuff

- Git? Nope, we're using Subversion. TCS...
- Markdown?  No, MSFT Word. Sharepoint.  Robohelp.
- "It's ok you don't have automated tests..."
- "Windows is an acceptable developer platform for JVM"
- Project too slow? ...better add more folks!

<br /><br />
/YOU:  Wow Charlie, are you just going to vent?  Ugghhhh.




###No... We have real problems to solve

<br /><br />

**And we are the ones to do it**

<br /><br />
I don't claim to have the answers... but<br />
We need to follow modern best practices and emulate a start up culture<br />




###How to mitigate our (growing) technical debt

- A broader Technical Currency initiative?
- Evolve organization into web development organization?
- Introduce newer technologies?
 - Angular? Node.js or Vert.x? Mongo or Redis? Hadoop? Pig? AWS? OAuth?
 - Budget time for developers to learn and share?
 - Adjust some focus away from legacy ERP evolution? (to apply technologies initially on greenfield projects)




###How to improve quality
<br />
We need to institutionalize more discipline

<br />

- Code reviews?
- Being test focused?
 - Employ Behavior Driven Development (BDD)?
 - Consolidate Continuous Integration? (CI as a service)?
- Use a common CLI (bash/zsh)?
- Use Git (even for 1 day personal exercises)?
- 'Ruthless' refactoring?
- Earlier focus on performance?




###How to improve productivity and time-to-market
